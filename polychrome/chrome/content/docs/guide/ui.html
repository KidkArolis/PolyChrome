			<p><img src="images/polyml_16x16_gray.png" /> - this icon means that PolyML is <strong>not active</strong> for this document and no Standard ML code found on this page will be executed.</p>
			<p><img src="images/polyml_16x16.png" /> - this icon means that PolyML is <strong>active</strong> for this document.</p>
			<p><strong>Note</strong> that by default, PolyML will never be active for documents containing no SML code. For documents containing SML code, the behavior depends on the <strong>Always Enable</strong> setting.</p>
			<p>Also <strong>note</strong> that once you've enabled PolyML for a certain tab containing SML code, it will remain enabled until you close the tab or stop PolyML via the context menu.</p>
