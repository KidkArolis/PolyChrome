			<p>A good way of trying out the extension is checking out the demos that can be opened via the context menu of the extension or by opening <a href="chrome://polychrome/content/demos/index.html">chrome://polychrome/content/demos/index.html</a> (note that this link will only work in Firefox with PolyChrome installed).</p>
			<p>These demos are not intended to be polished applications. They were created for a proof-of-concept reasons. Some of them, in fact, demonstrate the limitations of the extension.</p>
