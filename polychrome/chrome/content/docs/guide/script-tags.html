			<p>There are several ways of embedding SML into the HTML documents.</p>
			<h2>Embedding code</h2>
			<p>This could be used for short snippets of code.</p>
			<pre>
&lt;script type=&quot;application/x-polyml&quot;&gt;
  (* sml code *)
&lt;/script&gt;
			</pre>
			<h2>Embedding sml files</h2>
			<p>This could be used to embed larger applications. In this case, the files are compiled immediately after they are downloaded.</p>
			<pre>
&lt;script type=&quot;application/x-polyml&quot; src=&quot;link/to/file1.sml&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;application/x-polyml&quot; src=&quot;link/to/file2.sml&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
			</pre>
			<h2>Embedding zip files</h2>
			<p>This could be used for large applications including many files. The zip file is downloaded to the client and extracted into a temporary sandbox directory.</p>
			<pre>
&lt;script type=&quot;application/x-polyml&quot; src=&quot;link/to/file.zip&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
			</pre>
			<h2>Sandbox</h2>
			<p>In all of the above cases, a temporary sandbox (it's not really a sandbox at the moment, that is you can freely browse the filesystem of the clients computer from the SML script) directory is created on the clients machine. The working directory of the toplevel PolyML shell is always set to that sandbox, thus you can access the downloaded files as they are all placed into this sandbox directory. These temporary directories are created in <pre>your_firefox_profile/extensions/polychrome@ed.ac.uk/sandboxes</pre></p>
			<h2>&nbsp</h2>
			<p>Obviously, a combination of the above could also be used. For example, you might include a large application by embedding the zip file and include a short snippet of code in HTML initializing the application.</p>
