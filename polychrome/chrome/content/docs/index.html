			<p class="intro">
				PolyChrome is an extension for Firefox web browser that can run Standard ML programs embedded in HTML documents. The extension provides a simple foreign function interface to JavaScript. As a result, JavaScript libraries and interfaces provided by the browser, such as DOM and Canvas, can be used from Standard ML.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Why do this?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>HTML, CSS and browser technologies such as Canvas or Scalabble Vector Graphics support provide Standard ML with a way of creating Graphical User Interfaces or graphics in general.</li>
				<li>Easy deployment of SML applications. If PolyML and PolyChrome is installed, opening the URL (remote or local) of the application is all it takes to run it.</li>
				<li>Cross-platform GUIs (though Windows currently are not supported :)</li> 
			</ul>
			
			<h3>What are the limitations?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The JavaScript FFI is rather inefficient therefore applications using this FFI intensively, e.g. rendering animations, might be slow.</li>
				<li>The memory sharing mechanism between JavaScript and Standard ML is not fully automated, which means that some manual memory management might be needed to prevent memory leaks.</li>
				<li>Running remote applications is potentially harmful (as there are currently no limits on what SML can be executed on the client's machine).</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>How does it work?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The JavaScript component of the extension that is executed by Firefox opens up a PolyML process for each HTML document and runs the Standard ML component of the extension.</li>
				<li>A socket connection is established between the JavaScript and Standard ML components.</li>
				<li>DOM, Canvas, etc. libraries are loaded in PolyML.</li>
				<li>Those libraries use the socket connection to forward any JavaScript function call to the JavaScript component, where it get's executed.</li>
				<li>Because the browser provides a JavaScript interface to DOM, we can now access and modify DOM from Standard ML code.</li>
				<li>The SML code from the HTML document is grabbed by the JavaScript component and sent for evaluation to the Standard ML component</li>
				<li>More details are provided in the <a href="docs.html">documentation</a></li>
