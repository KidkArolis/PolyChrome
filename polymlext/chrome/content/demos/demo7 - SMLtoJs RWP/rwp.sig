(*
 [type 'a b] type of behavior with underlying values of type 'a.

 [type 'a e] type of event stream with underlying values of type 'a.

 [type ('b,'c,'k)arr] type of behavior (kind 'k = B) or event stream
 (kind 'k = E) transformers from type 'b to type 'c.

 [arr f] returns a transformer by lifting the function f to work on
 behaviors or events.

 [f >>> g] returns the transformer resulting from composing f and
 g. From the arrow laws, we have "arr f >>> arr g == arr (g o f)".

 [fst f] returns a pair-transformer that works as f on the first
 component and as the identity on the second component.

 [snd f] returns a pair-transformer that works as f on the second
 component and as the identity on the first component.

 [f *** g] returns a pair-transformer that works as f on the first
 component and as g on the second component.

 [f &&& g] returns a transformer that given input x will generate
 pairs (f x, g x) as outputs.

 [timer n] returns a time behavior that updates itself every n
 microseconds.

 [textField id] returns a string behavior holding the current content
 of an input field value identified by id. Raises Fail if there is no
 element identified by id in the DOM.

 [mouseover id] returns a boolean behavior with a value indicating
 whether the mouse is over the element identified by id. Raises Fail
 if there is no element identified by id in the DOM.

 [mouse()] returns a pair behavior for the x-y positions of the mouse
 relative to the upper-left corner of the browser window.

 [pair(b1,b2)] returns a behavior for the pair of the two behaviors b1
 and b2. Sem[pair(b1,b2)] = \t.(Sem[b1]t,Sem[b2]t).

 [merge(e1,e2)] returns the event stream resulting from merging the
 two event streams e1 and e2.

 [delay n b] returns a behavior equal to b but delayed n microseconds.

 [calm n b] returns a behavior equal to b but which is updated only
 when there has been no changes in b for n microseconds.

 [fold f a e] returns an event stream resulting from accumulating the
 results of calling f on events in e.

 [click id a] returns an event stream (of a's) representing clicks on
 an element identified by id. Raises Fail if there is no element
 identified by id in the DOM.

 [changes b] returns an event stream representing changes to the
 bahavior b.

 [hold a es] returns a behavior holding the value of the previous
 element in the event stream es with a being the initial value.

 [const a] returns the constant behavior with value a. Sem(const a) =
 \t.a.

 [empty()] returns the empty event stream.

 [iff (x,y,z)] returns the behavior which is y when x is true and z
 when x is false. Sem[iff (x,y,z)] = \t.if Sem[x](t) then Sem[y](t)
 else Sem[z](t).

 [when (x,y)] returns the behavior that changes according to y when x
 is true and otherwise does not change. The initial value of the
 resulting behavior is identical to the current value of y. Sem[when(x,y)] =
 \t.if Sem[x](t) then Sem[y](t) else Sem[y](t-delta).

 [until (x,y)] returns the behavior that changes according to y until
 x becomes true the first time. After this, the resulting behavior is
 constant. The initial value of the resulting behavior is identical to
 the current value of y.

 [current b] returns the current value of the behavior b.

 [poll f n] returns a behavior holding the values resulting from
 calling the function f every n microseconds.

 [insertDOM id b] effectively inserts the behavior in the DOM tree
 under the element identified by id. Raises Fail if there is no
 element identified by id in the DOM.
