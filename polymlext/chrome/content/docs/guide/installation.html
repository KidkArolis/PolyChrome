		<h1>Installation</h1>
		<div class="section">
			<p>To use the PolyML Extension you'll need to install <a href="http://polyml.org/download.html">PolyML</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/262830/">the PolyMLext extension itself</a>.
			<h2>Test It</h2>
			<p>After you've done that, you can check whether it's working by opening up Firefox, right clicking the extension icon at the bottom right corner of the browser and clicking <strong>Start PolyML</strong>.</p>
			<img src="images/startPolyML.png" />
			<p>The label should change to <strong>Initializing...</strong>. This means that the neccessary heaps are being built for the first time. After the label changes to <strong>PolyML</strong> as in the screenshot below try entering some Standard ML code into the console (if you can't see the console click on the PolyMLext icon).<p>

			<p>Click on the icon to go to settings of the extension and configure the path to your PolyML installation.</td>
