PolyMLext
---------
PolyMLext allows you to run PolyML (Standard ML) applications in Firefox
browser. It also provides an interface for manipulating the DOM as well as
calling JavaScript functions.


Running the extension
---------------------

There are two ways to install the extension.

1. Run the deploy script like this:

   #./deploy package
   
   This will create polymlext.xpi file that can be opened with firefox.
   
2. For development, it's convenient to use another method.
   * Edit the deploy script and update the path to your firefox profile
   * You can run firefox by executing
   
     # ./deploy run
   
     This will also run the error console where JavaScript debug info is
     printed.
    
Demos
-----

 * Right click on the PolyML icon in the statusbar of Firefox and then click
   "Demos".
