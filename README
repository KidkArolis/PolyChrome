To use the extension
--------------------

 * Edit the path to your firefox profile in the deploy.sh script.
 * Run the deploy.sh script with build option:
    e.g $ ./deploy.sh build
 * Then run Firefox. You can execute deploy script with run option to do that:
    e.g. $ ./deploy.sh run
    
    
Other tips
----------

 * You should see a red PolyML logo in the status bar of the browser (or check
    Tools > Add-ons ;)
 * Use "Tools > Error Console" to observe various log info printed out in the
    extension.
 * To see an example page with PolyML code open:
    chrome://polymlext/content/test.html


Problems
--------

If building the extension failed, you'll have to dig through the deploy script
to see what went wrong ;) or let me know at assembla.com/spaces/polymlext/
