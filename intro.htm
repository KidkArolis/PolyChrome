		<h2>Warning :)</h2>
		<p>PolyChrome is still in an early stage of development. Hopefully, one day it will be polished at least a bit more. For now, as you'll see in the documentation and the code, some things are not as nice or as clear as they could be, but you're welcome to contribute with comments, ideas or code.</p>
		<p>Also, this documentation is not meant to be exhaustive.</p>
		<h2>Updating the extension</h2>
		<p>As of now, the extension has not been reviewed by Mozilla, therefore no updates of the extension will be automatically pushed to your browser. You'll have to manually check for new versions of the extension at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/271847/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/271847/</a>.</p>
